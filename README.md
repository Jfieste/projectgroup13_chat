# Group Chat Application 

In this study project we will implement a distributed chat application with multiple client and server and demonstrate the topics from the distributed systems lessons

Information sharing takes place in various everyday situations, for example talking to a friend about the US election results or some homework you were given. Electronic communication has become the fastest and most used method of communication nowadays. For our project we decided to implement a group chat application, where users can send messages to a group and receive messages from other participants of the group too. The system will only support one group. 


We have completed the following requirements in our project: 

##### -> Dynamic host discovery 
##### -> Leader election via voting algorithm
##### -> Fault tolerance of leader server/ replica server chashes 
##### -> Detection of leader server crashes by heartbeat message
##### -> Ordered reliable multicast protocol based on VectorClock 

In addition, we have a user interface where participants can log in at the group and send/receive messages with the date and time of the messages.
